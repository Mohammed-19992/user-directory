## Title of the App:
User Directory

## Overview & Technologies Used:
This app is built with react using react-build-app and deployed with Heroku.

When the user loads the page, a table of employees renders, and the user is able to sort the table by the name alphabetically (from A to Z or from Z to A). The user also has the ability to search for the name of the user using the search bar.

## Review
* The URL of the app on Heroku: https://rocky-hollows-15070.herokuapp.com/
* The URL of the GitHub repository: https://github.com/Mohammed-19992/user-directory

## Future Plans
